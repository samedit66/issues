# issues

Console utility to list `n` oldest issues from a GitHub repo. Taken from the `Programming Elixir` book and updated to Elixir 1.19.4 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 28).

## Usage

```bash
issues [ user repo ] | [ user repo n ]
```

Let's list 4 last oldest issues from `Elixir` repo:

```bash
issues elixir-lang elixir 4
```

You'll likely to get something like this (it looked like that at 2025.01.30):

```bash
number | created_at           | title

8095   | 2018-08-16T20:32:52Z | Provide an API to access documentation metadata at compile time
```

When `n` is not specified, it defaults to `4`.
